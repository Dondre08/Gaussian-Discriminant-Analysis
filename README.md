# Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
Conducted a Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis for the MNIST and SPAM datasets

**SPAM Dataset:** Contains text of emails, with the goal to classify these emails as HAM (good emails) or SPAM (junk emails)

**MNIST Dataset:** Contains handwritten digits, with the goal to classify these digits as one of 0 to 9

For the SPAM Dataset, my LDA Classifier achieved an accuracy of 77.7%.
For the MNIST dataset, my LDA Classfier performed best and achieved an accuracy of 87.8%, whereas my QDA Classifier achieved an accuracy of 85.6%.
